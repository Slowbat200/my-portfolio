            Currently working on my biggest project of all time. Its gonna be a
            website with courses about Web Development, which includes basic web
            languages and their libraries and frameworks. I&apos;d like to make
            the courses more fun than they are on other platforms. Which means
            there will be more practice than theory, there will be quizzes and a
            lot of other fun content.

            After I end up in the school I started learning by my own and
            started exploring, for me, new technologies. I began learning,
            modern technologies such as React, Next.js, TailwindCSS or MongoDB.

            In summer 2022 I started working on my graduation project. It was
            first version of Web Development courses. It was developed only with
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            After graduation I realized it needed a change, then many versions
            of this project came out.

            This was the year I first started learning about web development,
            this is where my journey as a web developer began. Since then I have
            created many projects and learned many new things that I still use
            today
